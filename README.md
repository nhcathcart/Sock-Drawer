# sockdrawer

Sometimes you gotta organize your sock drawer. Sockdrawer is a tracking app for any tasks you may have. Drag from 'fresh' to 'folding'. Add some sub-tasks while its folding. Roll em up? Automate your folding process. Who knows!? Write a note or two about the way you just found to fold a fitted sheet. Then when its done drag it to 'put away'. 

Next step is to add an export function for our 'put away' items. Maybe we will call it 'moth balls'. Cheers.
